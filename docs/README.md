* [I want my users to have always-up-to-date CA-Cert files](features/RemoteFetch.md)
* [I just want an updated CA-Cert file in a predictable location](features/RemoteFetch.md#symlinks)
* [I need to run a custom/internal certificate authority while also trusting the most recent CA certs](features/LocalCACertBuilder.md)
